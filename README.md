# LFABM (Local Food Agent-Based Modeling)
(by Yuji Saikai & Elan Segarra, PhD students at University of Wisconsin - Madison)

We model local food systems, which seem to be governed by distinctive factors compared to conventional food systems.  The model is built on [Mesa](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa). So, first, please install Mesa following the instruction there. Then, for simple visualization,

1. Run server.py
2. Go to http://localhost:8888

or for detailed debugging,

1. Run console.py # (#: an integer for the number of periods)
