# LFABM (Local Food Agent-Based Modeling)
(by Yuji Saikai & Elan Segarra, PhD students at University of Wisconsin - Madison)

We try to model local food systems, which seem to be governed by distinct factors from those in conventional food systems.  The model is built on [Mesa](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa). So, first, please install Mesa following the instruction there. Then,

1. Run main.py
2. Run server.py
3. Go to http://localhost:8888
