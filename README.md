# LFABM (Local Food Agent-Based Modeling)
(by Yuji Saikai & Elan Segarra, PhD students at University of Wisconsin - Madison)

We model local food systems, which seem to be governed by distinctive factors compared to conventional food systems.  The model is built on [Mesa](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa). So, first, please install Mesa following the instruction there. Then,

1. Run server.py
2. Go to http://localhost:8888

for simple visualization, or

1. Run console.py with a single integer argument

for detailed debugging  (e.g. _python console.py 52_ for 52-period run).

You may change or add parameter values in parameters.csv.
